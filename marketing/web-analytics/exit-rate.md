# Exit Rate
The exit rate of a page is the metric that calculates the percentage of visitors that leave your site at that specific page. This metric can be particularly misleading and hard to interpret: how do you know whether users left that page because it sucks or because they're finished using the site? For example, if a user exits from the order confirmation page, that can be seen as a success.

There are two cases where the exit rate is a useful metric:
* The [[bounce-rate]] is a more specific exit-rate metric that really ensures you the user left dissatisfied.
* The other one is for [[funnel]]s or structured experiences, where a user should go through each step of the process in an ordered manner, and leaving one in the mid of the funnel can always be considered as a failure.
