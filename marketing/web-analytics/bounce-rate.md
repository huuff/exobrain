# Bounce Rate
The percentage of [[session|sessions]] with no interactions. That is, the percentage of sessions where the user exits immediately after starting.

Avinash Kaushik calls this *the sexiest web metric ever* because:

* It's available in pretty much every web analytics tool ever.
* It's really hard to misunderstand what it measures.
* It's actionable on multiple levels, especially at diagnosing and fixing low-hanging fruits of optimization.
* It measures customer behavior.

### Analysis
Some ideas on how to analyze it:

* Measure bounce rate on your landing pages. Which one have the highest bounce rate? Perhaps these suck and are driving customers away
* Segment them by referrer. Maybe your landing page is not an appropriate destination for a visitor from that referrer if bounce rate is high.
* Measure them by campaign or by search keywords. This can have similar implications to the previous point.
