# Conversion Rate
Usually the most important metric for any site: the percentage of people who visit our site and end up doing a purchase (or finishing any other measurable process that's considered a success for us).

## Two definitions
There are usually two ways of defining it

$$$
\frac{\text{Number of conversions}}{\text{Number of visits}}
$$$

Or

$$$
\frac{\text{Number of conversions}}{\text{Number of unique visitors}}
$$$

Which one you use greatly affects the mental model of your metric. When using visits as the denominator, you're assuming that usually a user will convert within any given visit, while if using the unique visits, you assume the user may come several times to the site before finally converting.

Purchases are very likely to be done after some period of consideration, so the second definition (unique visitors as the denominator) is usually the best one for these types of conversions.
