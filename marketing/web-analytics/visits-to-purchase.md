# Visits to purchase
Most purchases are not done on first visit. Usually customers like to reflect about purchasing a product before hitting the button. This metric covers this case:

* What it is: The analytics tool tracks every visit of the customer and then tracks the purchase. These are stitched together to easure how many visits it takes before they purchase.
* What it tells: It talks about the behavior of customers that take some time to purchase. What is it that finally convinces them on the last visit?
* What to do next: It's *sister report* is *days to purchase*. The intersection of these tells you how recent are the visits of the customer before deciding to purchase.
