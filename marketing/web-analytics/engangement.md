# Engagement
A catch-all term for a lot of different metrics that is (was?) usually used, even though its misleading. There are many ways we can define how a customer is "engaged" and calling them by their names might be much better than just calling them "engagement". For example:

* [[time-on-site]]: If your customers spend more time on your site, they might enjoy it there (or they might be frustrated looking for something they can't find)
* [[repeat-visits]]: If your customers come back frequently, they might like your site (or they can't find what they look for, again)
* [[visit-depth]]: Same as all, customers might be visiting many pages because they enjoy them, or just searching aimlessly
* [[customer-satisfaction]]: One of the best, just measure it through surveys, or ask for *likelyhood to recommend*
