# Ad Serving Platforms use Third-Party Cookies
==This information might be a bit outdated since I got it from the Web Analytics 2.0 book which is from 2009==

Even though third-party cookies get rejected and deleted by browsers much more often, ad-serving platforms typically use them since they are the only way they can track a user across several different websites. Ad-serving platform can use your previous browsing history to give you relevant ads. This is impossible with first-party cookies since they can only be used by the same site.
