# Container Security
I loved this book by Liz Rice! It's pretty short at 200 pages yet densely packed with in-depth information and actionable advice. I especially liked:
* The overview of container networking
* How emphasized the benefits of image scanning are
* The examples of [[linux/namespace]]s
