# Eloquent Javascript
I loved this book! Marijn (the author) seems like a pretty knowledgeable guy about a variety of topics. He's fun and entertaining (I laughed my ass off at the "Crow Technology" chapter). Delves deeply into [[javascript]] and browser concepts. Also the projects and code samples are very fun and interesting, there are:

* A nice simulation of a distributed system in the "Crow Technology" chapter.
* Implementing a programming language
* Implementing a platform game
* Implementing a pixel art editor

My only criticism is that his code is really clever and succint, maybe *too* clever, as it gets hard to understand.
