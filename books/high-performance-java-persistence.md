# High Performance Java Persistence
Really good book. The author is a top contributor to Hibernate and there's a lot of deep knowledge embedded here. My only complain is that some topics presented early on depend on stuff that gets explained closer to the end. But structuring knowledge sequentially is hard anyways.
