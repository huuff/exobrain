# MongoDB - The Definitive Guide
Was expecting the typical dry reference book on some piece of software but actually I'm kinda surprised at how much I learned from this book (but also considering that I had no previous clue about MongoDB). It's not only a pretty good book on MongoDB but also on databases overall. Some points:

* In-depth exploration of `.explain()` and understanding its significance and finding query performance issues (though maybe it was too early in the book?)
* There is a short mention of a lot of MongoDB schema design patterns but sadly it's limited to a paragraph each. Some are expanded a bit upon later in the book in random places but I'd like to see a more in-depth explanation of these. Maybe there are some other books for that.
