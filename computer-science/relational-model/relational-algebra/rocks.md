# What rocks about relational algebra
* Thanks to being a formal system, it can be used to design standarized algorithms for achieving optimality, such as [[normalization]].
* Also, relational databases using [[sql]] usually compile queries to a lower-level reperesentation based on [[relational-algebra]], and this can be used to use formal algorithms for optimizing them.
