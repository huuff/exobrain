# Redis University
It's ok. A lot like [[mongodb-university]]. Instructors don't look so smug, the environment they give you suck ass too. My biggest complain is that it's obvious that nobody involved in the courses knew any Java. Some examples of this:

* I've seen (in a video, don't remember which one) syntax that doesn't even exist such as:
```
Map.of(
  key1 = "value",
  key2 = "value"
)
```
* The RedisJSON course (and maybe some more I forgot) uses [[java/raw-types]] everywhere.
