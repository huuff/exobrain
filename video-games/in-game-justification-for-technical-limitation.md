# In-Game Justification for Technical Limitation
It's a nice idea: cover your technical limitations by supplying some lore explanation of it, maybe even design some extra system to hide or sweeten the limitation:

* Dragon's Dogma: Since you can't swim off from shore to anywhere far away, the "brine" is introduced as a sort of omnipresent sea monster that kills you whenever you go away from the shore when swimming. This is excellently handled since I don't think swimming works for anything but you can just do it even though it results in certain death, and the brine comes with according effects animations just for this. Any of this could be wrong since it was long ago I last played it.
* Superman 64: The game has very poor draw distance, so a green fog is introduced and called it "Kryptonite Fog", justifying that Lex Luthor created it to hamper Superman.
