Personal Zettelkasten

## Is it plagiariasm?
Most of my notes are straight out shamelessly copy-pasted paragraphs or code from books or articles I've found around. This is intended to be for personal use only and I found little use on keeping sources (only when referring back to them can add additional info) and given the highly connected nature of a zettelkasten, with too many different small notes, It'd be time-consuming and just add noise.

I'm only keeping it public because I don't really care and don't think anyone is even gonna read it anyway. I guess I'll have to take it down if I get sued.
