# Seven rules for a great commit message
A framework by Chris Beams ([source](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/)) for writting commit messages:

* Separate subject from body with a blank line
* Limit the subject line to 50 characters
* Capitalize the subject line
* Do not end the subject line with a period
* Use the imperative mood in the subject line
* Wrap the body at 72 characters
* Use the body to explain the *what* and *why* vs the *how*
