# Editing hunks is hard
When editing a hunk (such as through [[partial-staging]]), you will be presented with all of the hunk changes in patch format inside a text editor. This format is notably dificult to work with as a human, and you have to keep in mind the start, ending line and the amount of added/removed lines. Editing hunks directly in a text editor is not recommended and a graphical interface can greatly help.
