# Triple dot operator
By using `«first commit»...«second commit»` you can specify a [[commit-range]] that includes commits that are reachable by any of the commits specified, but not by both of them. That is, the difference between their histories. This is useful for checking [[difference-between-two-divergent-branches]]
