# What sucks about git
* There are some cases of several terms used to describe the same thing, even some of git commands and flags might use one term or the other inconsistently. For example, the [[staging-area]] might be called the *index* or the *cache*.
* There are two different meanings to [[rebase]]: either a different way of merging branches or a way of rewritting already-made commits.
