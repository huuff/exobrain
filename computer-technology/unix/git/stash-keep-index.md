# `git stash --keep-index`
This command will keep anything you've added to the [[staging-area]] but [[stash]] the rest.

### Usages
It's useful if you want to keep some of your current work (the staged one) but save the rest for later (stash it), so you can commit only part of it. ==this is particularly useful for me now since I'm suffering from a script that always stages anything in the [[working-directory]] automatically==
