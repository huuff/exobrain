# Double dot commit range
You can specify a commit range by doing `«first commit»..«last commit»`. This means to use all commits that are reachable from `«first commit»` but not from `«last commit»`

### Examples
If you want to get all commits in the `experiment` [[git/branch]] that aren't in the `master` branch you can do `git log master..experiment`
