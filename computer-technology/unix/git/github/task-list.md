# Task list
Github Flavored Markdown allows you to embed list of tasks to fulfill by using the following notation:

```
- [] Task not done
- [X] Done task
```

These are used in [[pull-request|pull-requests]] to show lists of tasks to be done before being merged. These also get a visual representation by a progress bar in the pull request summary.
