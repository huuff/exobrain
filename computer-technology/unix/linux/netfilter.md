# `netfilter`
`netfilter` is a kernel module that allows to define rules about what to do with a packet depending on its [[osi-networking-model|layer 3 information]], such as performing load-balancing, NAT translation or firewalling. There are two main ways of operating it:

* [[iptables]]
* [[ipvs]]
