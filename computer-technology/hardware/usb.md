# USB
Through the 80s there was a proliferation of different device interfaces with no standarization such as:
* Serial ports
* Parallel ports
* Specific ports for keyboards and mice

In 1994 a bunch of tech giants such as Microsoft and IBM teamed to design a standard for all devices that two years later came as the USB (Universal Serial Bus) standard
