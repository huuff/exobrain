# Non-Uniform Memory Architecture (NUMA)
A setting that enables each CPU to take ownership of memory that's especially close to it, so it's some sort of "local" memory to that CPU.

This is usually good for many types of applications because they use different regions of memory, so the memory related to that process can be stored close to the CPU that works with it.
