# Query languages in MongoDB
There are two query languages in MongoDB:

* The MongoDB Query Language (MQL), used in `find` operations
* The Aggregation Query Language, used by the [[aggregation-framework]]

These differ in the syntax of their [[operator]]s (among other differences).

It's important to note that the MongoDB query languages are imperative contrary to SQL ==TODO: citation needed==
