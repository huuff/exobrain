# Query languages in MongoDB
There are two query languages in MongoDB:

* The MongoDB Query Language (MQL), used in `find` operations
* The Aggregation Query Language, used by the [[aggregation-framework]]

It's important to note that the MongoDB query languages are imperative contrary to SQL ==TODO: citation needed==

## Differences
* The syntax of [[operator]]s is different (refer to that link to learn more about it)
* MQL is more suited for simple, single-document queries, while the aggregation framework is suited for queries that require complex data processing.
