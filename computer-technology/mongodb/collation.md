# Collation
A *collation* in MongoDB allows the use of language-specific rules for string comparison (i.e. ignoring accents).

You can make a collation in a document by adding the `locale` key with [one of the available locales](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/collation-locales-defaults/#std-label-collation-languages-locales) ==is this correct?==
