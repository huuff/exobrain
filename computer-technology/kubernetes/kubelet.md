# `kubelet`
One of the main processes that defines Kubernetes functionality. I'm not entirely sure what the `kubelet` responsibilities are because I'm sure there are a lot of them such as:

* Interacting with the [[containerization/runtime]]
* Interacting with the [[containerization/cni]]
* Interacting with the [[containerization/csi]]

The `kubelet` is the process that runs in the worker nodes and manages the workloads.
