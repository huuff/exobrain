# Annotation
Annotations are metadata, but, contrary to [[label]]s, their sole purpose is to provide (or store) that information for other software ([[controller]]s or [[operator]]s for example).

### Examples
* Keep track of the reason for the last update to the object
* A reference to the [[replica-set]] that manages a [[pod]]
* Build, release or other version information
* Add extra functionality, like `rewrite-target` for `ingress-nginx`
