# Knative
A project that aims to provide FaaS/[[scale-to-zero]] capabilities to Kubernetes clusters. It can also provide more advanced deployment models such as [[blue-green-deployment]] and [[canary-deployment]]

There are two main Knative projects

* [[knative-serving]]
* [[knative-eventing]]
* There used to be a Knative building, but it's been factored out as [[tekton]]
