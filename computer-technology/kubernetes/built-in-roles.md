# Built-in roles
Sometimes you can just reach out for a built-in role instead of having to build your [[rbac]]. These are:

* `cluster-admin`: full privileges across the whole cluster
* `admin`: full privileges on a single [[namespace]]
* `edit`: edit privileges on a single [[namespace]]
* `view`: read-only access on a single [[namespace]]
