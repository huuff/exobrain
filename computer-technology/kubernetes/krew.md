# Krew
Krew is a package manager for `kubectl` plugins (which follow the [[subcommand-plugins]] convention). `krew` is itself a Kubernetes plugin so you just run it wich `kubectl krew`

Check out [this guide on naming conventions for plugins](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/docs/developer-guide/develop/naming-guide/)
