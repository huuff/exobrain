# Gardener
A very cool project from SAP that allows Kubernetes federation. It's made to support thousands of Kubernetes clusters, specially targeted to Kubernetes PaaS providers.

It's kind of novel and interesting since it abstracts Kubernetes' management features through Kubernetes-native features such as an [[extended-api]], [[crd]]s and controllers (So, an [[operator]]?)
