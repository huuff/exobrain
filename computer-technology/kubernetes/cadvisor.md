# cAdvisor
As of v1.23 I think this is [in the process of getting deprecated](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2371).

A component that collects resources and metrics for containers running on a node. It's built-in into the [[kubelet]] and collects memory and CPU usage through the [[cgroup]].
