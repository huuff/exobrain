# ISO-8559
A series of extensions to the ASCII character set: ISO-8559 character sets use the (previously unused) eight bit of ASCII to add more characters (specific to some language or language family) to the character set. For example:

* `Ã¬so-8559-1` or `iso-latin-1` adds characters for western european languages
* `iso-8559-2` adds characters for central european languages
* `iso-8559-5` adds cyrillic characters
* `iso-8559-6` adds arabic characters
* `iso-8559-15` adds the euro sign to `iso-8559-1`
