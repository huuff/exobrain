# Automated PKI
This is a real game-changer with [[swarm-mode]]. All nodes in the swarm are automatically secure with zero-configuration. All communication between nodes in a swarm is encrypted through TLS.

Swarm mode automatically creates a [[certificate-autority]], [[signing-request]]s and certificates for all nodes, and even automatically rotates them.
