# Swarm mode
A special mode included with Docker that does is two main things:

* A secure cluster of Docker hosts
* An engine for orchestrating microservices apps

Swarm mode is a direct competitor to [[kubernetes]], but it's much easier to use and its defaults are much saner. This project, however, is pretty much dead. Seems quite surprising how easily the swarm devs gave up on the orchestrator wars.
