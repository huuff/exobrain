# Exit an interactive session on a container
Not unlike [[exit-telnet-on-spanish-keyboard]] I always struggle remembering and executing this one. The keys are `Ctrl+P+Q`, which means keeping `Ctrl` pressed, then press `P` and then `Q`

==I think QEMU uses `Ctrl+Shift+A`? Maybe virtualization and containerization providers should come to some agreement for an specificication of exit key sequence==
