# Exit an interactive session on a container
Not unlike [[exit-telnet-on-spanish-keyboard]] I always struggle remembering and executing this one. The keys are `Ctrl+P+Q`, which means:

* Press `Ctrl` and keep it pressed
* Press `Shift + P` without letting go `Ctrl`
* Press `Shift + Q` still without letting go `Ctrl`

Hopefully this for-dummies explanation helps me the next time I'm unable to do it

==I think QEMU uses `Ctrl+Shift+A`? Maybe virtualization and containerization providers should come to some agreement for an specificication of exit key sequence==
