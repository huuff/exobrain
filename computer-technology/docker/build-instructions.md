# Build instructions
There are only a few instructions available to a Docker build file. These must be the first word in a line, and are usually specified in all-caps for clarity, though it's not mandatory.

* `FROM`: Must be the first instruction in the Dockerfile, it specifies the base image on which to build this image.
