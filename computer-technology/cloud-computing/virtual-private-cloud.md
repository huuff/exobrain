# Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
A set of resources that run on a public cloud, but where additional measures are taken to isolate it from the rest of users running in the same cloud. In a public cloud all resources running in the same cloud can contact each other, but in a private cloud, only resources in the same private cloud can contact each other.
