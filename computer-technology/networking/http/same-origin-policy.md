# Same Origin Policy
A principle in internet HTTP applications (such as browsers) where a resource is only given permission to act on resources on the same origin (as defined by [[web-origin|RFC 6454]]).

As given by section 3.4.2 of RFC 6454:

>  However, an origin is permitted to use some kinds of resources
   retrieved from other origins.  For example, an origin is permitted to
   execute script, render images, and apply style sheets from any
   origin.  Likewise, an origin can display content from another origin,
   such as an HTML document in an HTML frame.
