# Content negotiation
A main feature of HTTP that allows a client and server to negotiate what kinds/types/versions of data they can trade, for example:

* Encodings using the `Accept-Encoding` and `Content-Encoding` headers
* Internationalization, using the `Accept-Language` and `Accept-Charset` (for the client) and `Content-Language` (for the server) headers
