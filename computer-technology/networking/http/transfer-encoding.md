# `Transfer-Encoding`
This [[http/header]] specifies the encoding used for the transportation of the message, and it's different (and can be used in conjuntion to) the [[content-encoding]] header.

AFAIK, the only type of transfer encoding in the specification is [[http/chunked-encoding]]

Transfer encoding is deprecated as of [[http2]]
