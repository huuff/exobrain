# Reverse proxy (AKA Gateway)
As defined by RFC 9110:

> A gateway (a.k.a. reverse proxy) is an intermediary that acts as an origin server for the outbound connection but translates received requests and forwards them [[inbound-outbound|inbound]] to another server or servers. Gateways are often used to encapsulate legacy or untrusted information services, to improve server performance through accelerator caching, and to enable partitioning or load balancing of HTTP services across multiple machines
