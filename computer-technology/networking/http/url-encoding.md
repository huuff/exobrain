# URL Encoding
Characters not supported in URLs can be specified by using the URL-Encoding escapes, which are composed of a percentage sign followed by two hexadecimal characrers that specify the code of the caracter in the ASCII set.

### Example
An espace is unsupported in URLs. The space is the 32th character in ASCII. Therefore, it's encoded in URLs as `%20` (`20` is `32` in hexadecimal)
