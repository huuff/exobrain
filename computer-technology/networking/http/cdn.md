# Content-Delivery Network (CDN)
A CDN is a globally distributed network of reverse proxies. Their goal is to be able to serve resources to users while being as close as possible to them, this enables them to:

* Act as an intermediary to implement newer technologies such as HTTP/3
* Reduce latency
* Mitigate overloads and DDoS attacks.

Cloudflare is a CDN.
