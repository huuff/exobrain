# Charset is poorly named in MIME
The charset in the MIME standard is a poor name. This field specifies a total algorithm for mapping data bits to codes and to unique characters, so this conflates two different things: a [[character-encoding-scheme]] and a [[coded-character-set]]. 

It's important to take this in consideration, as there are other standards about character sets that use a different definition.
