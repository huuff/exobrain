# Distroless images
AFAIK, these are a set of very stripped-down base container images by Google. These are specifically designed for some programming language containing only the bare minimum:

* The programming language runtime such as the JDK
* CA bundles to use TLS
* Locale information

That means, no shell, no package manager, etc.
