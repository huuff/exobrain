# Licensing
The ESXi hypervisor is free to use, for unlimited machines, with some limitations to the configuration and the machine and tool. Anything else has to be paid for, and since most features depend on vCenter, most of the ecosystem is not available for free. (Check [[ecosystem]] for the names of the products).

There's a lifetime license for about $600 which includes vCenter for up to 3 ESXi instances. It looks pretty cool for small business or personal use. I might get it.
