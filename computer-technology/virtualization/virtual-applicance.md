# Virtual appliance
A virtual appliance is an application that is bundled as a virtual machine image. This ensures reproducibility and ease of deployment. Sometimes, to make them leaner, instead of including full operating systems, these just include the most essential parts of the operating system needed for their functionality (also called jeOS? Just Enough Operating System)

I'm not sure these are still in use, since [[containerization]] seems to achieve the same purposes in a much more efficient manner.
