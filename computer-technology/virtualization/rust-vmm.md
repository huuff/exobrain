# `rust-vmm`
A cool [[rust]] library for building [[hypervisor|VMMs]]. It's well tested so it might enable a proliferation of new specialized VMM architectures.

Some [[rust/crate|crates]] it contains are:
* `vm-memory`: A guest memory abstraction, providing a guest address, memory regions and shared guest memory.
