# VMware products
These names always confuse me

* **ESXi**: It's the hypervisor
* **vCenter Server**: Basically centralizes management of all managed VMs. Previously a Windows-only application, now it comes prebuilt in the *vCenter Server Appliance*
* **vSphere Update Manager**: Identifies out-of-date systems and automatically installs patches.
* **vSphere Client**: A HTML5 client for managing *vCenter Server*
