# VM tax
This terms refers to the significant overhead that comes with running a virtual machine:

* Each VM needs to emulate all low-level resources such as CPUs, RAM, storage, networking, etc.
* Each VM needs to run its own operating system with all of its related processes.
* Start-up times of a VM are high because of having to start all of those layers and processes.
