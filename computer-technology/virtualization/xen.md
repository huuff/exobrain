# Xen
I know virtually (pun intended) nothing about Xen other than:

* It's [[virtualization-types|type of virtualization]] is [[paravirtualiation]]
* Amazon uses it for EC2, so even though historically VMWare used to have the highest market share, Xen must have a bright future ahead of it. (Actually, it seems that EC2 also uses [[kvm]])
