# OVF
The Open Virtualization Format (OVF) is a standard for describing platform and vendor-agnostic virtual machine images. Theoretically these images should be portable across different vendors. Most vendors have options to export images to OVF.

## OVA
An OVF package actually is a set of different files. An OVA is just a single-file package that encompass them all. It's actually just a tarball.
