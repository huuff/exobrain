# Types of virtualization
* Hardware virtualization: An emulation layer is set between the guest OS and the underlying hardware (the [[hypervisor]]). Calls from the guest OS for physical resources must be intercepted by the [[hypervisor]], coordinated among multiple virtual machines and translate to its own drivers. It has the highest overhead of the three. [[esxi]] uses this kind of virtualization.
* Operating System level virtualization (a.k.a. containerization): A single operating system is shared among several *containerized* applications that are isolated from each other. It has the lowest overhead of the three (I think?) (See [[containerization-vs-virtualization]]). [[docker]] uses this kind of virtualization.
* [[paravirtualization]]: One virtual machine is run with special privileges (Domain0 in Xen) of access to the underlying hardware with actual drivers. The rest of virtual machines have stub drivers that actually contact the privileged VM for any resource needs. (Middle ground of performance of the three?). [[xen]] uses this kind of virtualization.
