# Guest tools
All virtualization products offer some software that can be installed in the guest OS to enable more features from the hypervisor. (e.g. [[vmware-tools]]). Some of the features these tools enable are:
* Cursor handling in Windows
* Time synchronization between the VM and the [[hypervisor]]
* Heartbeat to check VM health
* Executing scripts directly on the VM
* Shared clipboards
* Enhanced, faster drivers
* Shared folders
