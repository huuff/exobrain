# Diagram standards

* **Chen's notation**: This was the one originally used in [the paper that introduced the entity-relationship model](https://www.csc.lsu.edu/~chen/pdf/erd-5-pages.pdf).
* **IDEF1X**: Standarized by the U.S. National Institute for Standards and Technology. It uses vertical bars to denote [[participation|total participation]], hollow circles to denote [[participation|partial participation]] and "crow's feet" to denote the "many" cardinality
* **UML**: The Dabase System Concepts books uses a notation "closer" to UML class diagrams, but I'm not sure this is standard or where to find its standarization
