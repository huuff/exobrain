# `twemproxy`
A proxy for caches from twitter that allows load-balancing across instances and automatically sharding data. It can connect to backends in [[redis]] or Memcached.

Honestly I don't know whether this is still used, since now there's [[redis-cluster]], and also the latest commit in the project is from 2021 (as of writing in 2022)
