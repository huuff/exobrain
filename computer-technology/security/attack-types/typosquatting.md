# Typosquatting
A type of [[supply-chain-attack]], where the attacker uploads to a public central registry (such as the [[docker]] registry) a package with a name that's very similar to a popular one (e.g., a package named `pakage` while a package named `package` is used by thousands of consumers). This means that users that get a package name wrong during installation will install a malicious one.
