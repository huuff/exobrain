# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
A web application vulnerability in which an attacker causes a script to execute in the context of another site. This could be devastating to the web application since due to the [[same-origin-policy]], scripts that execute in the context of another site can access its cookies, potentially stealing cookies and session information.

Some types are:
* [[persistent-xss]]
* [[reflected-xss]]
* [[dom-based-xss]]
