# Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
When [[authentication]] requires an user to use two or more [[authentication-factor]]s. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is commonly used because more is overkill for most usecases.

Note that using more than one factor is different from using more than one credential, for example, using two passwords for logging in is still one-factor authentication.
