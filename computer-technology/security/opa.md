# Open Policy Agent (OPA)
An open source policy engine for specifying policies. It has a native [[kubernetes]] integration through [[admission-webhook]]s. It uses a DSL language called `rego` for defining policies.

Supposedly, it's more widely applicable than just Kubernetes, but I haven't seem much info regarding that around. I'm skeptic about it's utility, especially given that you have to learn a new language to use it.
