# Indistinguishability
A game to test the security of a cryptographic algorithm. In it, an attacker gives a system two equal-length messages and the system returns the encryption of both. The algorithm is said to be secure if no realistic attacker has more than 50% chance of guessing which encrypted message belongs to which original one.
