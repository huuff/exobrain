# CIA Triad
A triad of security goals that systems can strive to achieve:

* *Confidentiality*: Ensuring information can only be read by its intended audience
* *Integrity*: Preventing unathorized modification of information.
* *Availability*: Ensuring that users of a service can access it when intended and are not prevented from doing so. (e.g. preventing [[dos]])
