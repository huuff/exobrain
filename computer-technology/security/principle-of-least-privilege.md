# The principle of least privilege
A fundamental principle in security, quoting *Learn Kubernetes Security*:

> Privilege is the authority to perform an action such as accessing a resource or processing some data. The principle of least privilege is the idea that any subject, user, program, process, and so on should only have the minimum required privileges to perform its function.
