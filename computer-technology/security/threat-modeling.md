# Threat modeling
Is the process of analyzing the system as a whole during design to identify risks proactively. It's used to think about system security requirements early on, it involves:

* Identifying threats
* Understanding the effects of such threats
* Developing a mitigation strategy for the threat

The objective is to develop a matrix that contains the likelihood of each threat, its impact and a corresponding mitigation strategy.

## Approaches
* **STRIDE** (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service and Escalation of Privilege): Models threats to a system to answer the question: 'What can go wrong with the system?'
* **PASTA** (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis): Risk and attacker-centric approach.
* **VAST** (Visual, Agile and Simple Threat Modeling): Aims to integrate threat modeling across application and infrastructure development during the development lifecycle with agile software development. It provides a visualization scheme that provides actionable outputs.
