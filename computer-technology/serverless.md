# Serverless
As far as I know, a model of deployment where a cloud provider provides not only the infrastructure (the actual operating system) but also the programming environment and everything required to only run your application. 

## Types of serverless
* Long-running services where you only specify the required resources and a server is provisioned for you automatically.
* Scale-to-zero, FaaS, where the service is not running until it's used, then it's deployed, processes whatever needed and then removed when needed.

### A misnomer
Actually, a server is pretty much involved. Actual serverless would be a web, desktop or mobile application that runs entirelly in the device without contacting any backend.
