# Hypertext
The term *hypertext* was first coined in 1963 and first published in 1965 by Ted Nelson:

> ...a body of written or pictorial material interconnected in such a complex way that it could not conveniently be presented or represented on paper. It may contain summaries, or maps of its contents and their interrelations; it may contain annotations, additions and footnotes from scholars who have examined it.
