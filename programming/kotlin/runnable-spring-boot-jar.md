# How to make a runnable Spring Boot jar with Kotlin
If you create a Spring Boot project using the Kotlin initializr you'll see that the output jar is not runnable since it fails with a `NoClassDefFoundException` (or something similar I don't remember). Actually, this happens because it marks a class as a `SpringBootApplication` that is not the actual class that'll contain the `main` method in the compiled bytecode.

The solution is to actually declare that class postfixed with `Kt` (generated by the Kotlin compiler) as the entrypoint of the application. Using [[gradle]], this would be:

```kotlin
springBoot {
    mainClass.set("<fully qualified path to your SpringBootApplication class>Kt")
}
```
