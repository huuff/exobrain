# Convention
Kotlin conventions are specially named methods that can be used with a special syntaxis, they require the `operator` modifier to work as such. Examples

* `plus` -> `+`
* `minus` -> `-`
* `equals` -> `==`
* `plusAssign` -> `+=`

## Precedence
The precedence of operators is the same as for the regular ones (PEMDAS?)
