# Domain vs Distinct Types

* [[domain]]s can have [[integrity-constraint]]s such as `NOT NULL` associated with them. [[distinct-types]] cannot.
* [[domain]]s are not strongly typed, [[distinct-types]] are. Therefore, we can assign a value of one domain to another that uses the same underlying type.
