# Standard compliance
I find it funny how little compliance there is around with the SQL standard

* Almost no database system has [[stored-procedure]] compliance with it. Mainly because its specification came too late.
* Some of standarized features are basically unfeasible because of the performance penalties they impose, such as arbitrary queries in [[integrity-constraint]]s.
