# Participation
A term that refers to the fact that an [[entity]] forms part of a [[relationship]] and how it does, there's two forms:

* **Partial**: If the entity might or might not participate in the relationship
* **Total**: If the entity must participate in the relationship

## Diagrammatic representation

### [[diagram-standards|IDEF1X]]
On relationships with a "one" cardinality (such as [[one-to-many]] or [[one-to-one]]), the "one" side is represented by a circle if the relationship is partial, and no circle if it's total.
