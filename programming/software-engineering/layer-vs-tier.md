# Layer vs Tier

* A **layer** is a *logical* division of responsibilities in code
* A **tier** is a *physical* division of applications, so they may run on different infrastructure. (A **tier** is a *unit of deployment*)

> That being said, here's little reminder about layers of abstraction.  They are typically a good thing.  Remember though, that in "Scott World" (which is hopefully your world also :) ) a "Tier" is a unit of deployment, while a "Layer" is a logical separation of responsibility within code.  You may say you have a "3-tier" system, but be running it on one laptop.  You may say your have a "3-layer" system, but have only ASP.NET pages that talk to a database.  There's power in precision, friends.
