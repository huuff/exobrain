# Canary deployment
When a service is too complex to be effectively tested in development as to provide real security in its functionality, a *canary deployment* provides a sort of "testing in production" scenario: You deploy the newer version in a very limited amount (say 10%), enough to detect any errors without the possibility of having a catastrophic failure because of it.
