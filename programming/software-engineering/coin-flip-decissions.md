# Coin-flip decissions
A quote I really liked, in the foreword of the `Learning HTTP/2` about how the working group for HTTP/2 took hard decisions:

> For example, in a few cases it was agreed that moving forward wa more important than one person's argument carrying the day, so we made decisions by flipping a coing. While this might seem like madness to some, to me, it demonstrates maturity and perspective that's rare.
