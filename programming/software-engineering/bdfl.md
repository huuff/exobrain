# Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL)
A kind of open source software governance model, where a single person (usually the project's initiator) has the final say on all new additions to the code. This provides some benefits such as:
* A consistent vision for the future and philosophy of the project
* Accountability for any new or merged changes

Of course this can also be detrimental if the project's dictator abandons it.

### Examples
* (Up until recently) Guido van Rossum on Python.
* Linus Torvalds on Linux
* Salvatore Sanfilippo on [[redis]]
