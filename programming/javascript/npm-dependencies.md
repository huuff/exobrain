# Types of dependencies
* `dependencies`: runtime dependencies, these are transitive.
* `devDependencies`: compile-time dependencies, for example [[typescript]], which has no runtime effect
* `peerDependencies`: packages that are required at runtime but don't want to track. Are these legacy? I'm not sure
