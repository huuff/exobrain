# Shoelace Web Components
Awesome collection of reusable web components using [[lit-element]] and [[tailwind]]. That's compatible with any framework. Think of it like a superpowered [[css-framework]], but it's better since the components are fully-featured [[web-components]]. Also they look pretty good.
