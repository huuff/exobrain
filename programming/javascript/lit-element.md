# LitElement
A pretty awesome library for creating [[web-components]] that is:

* Really simple, just a base class and [[string-interpolation]] for specifying the [[html]]
* Natively reactive
* Compatible with any framework

It's so simple that it's really easy to embed in static html pages or in applications made with other frameworks.
