# `Date`
==TODO: The `Date` object is pure hell, I should collect more problems==
The object that represents a date in [[javascript]]. `new Date()` gives the current date.

### Inconsistency
The month is 0-indexed. Thus January is 0. Days are 1-indexed and thus the first day of the month is 1.

`getDate` returns the day of the month and `getDay` returns the day of the week which is kinda weird.
