# Bulma > Bootstrap
+ [[bulma]] has nicer semantically-named responsive sices: `mobile`, `tablet`, `desktop`, `widescreen`, `fullhd`. Of course these are not exactly equivalent, but gives a better hint on when they apply, while [[bootstrap]]'s `xs`, `sm`, `lg`, etc. are pretty relative.
+ [[bulma]]'s default selects don't take full width, unlike [[bootstrap]]'s. I think it's a sensible default.
+ [[bulma]] has the `level` component which I love and always miss in [[bootstra]] (I fall back to a `justify-content-between` flex)
+ [[bulma]] actually has a backdrop element for modals, which makes it much easier to manage through your framework. How does bootstrap actually do this? I think it's all done through javascript. (Or is that background the `modal-dialong` class? I should check it)
+ I really like how [[bulma]]s documentation explain to you what every class does in a nice nested list. There are some [[bootstrap]] classes that I've never known what they do, but just used them because the documentation's examples use them.
