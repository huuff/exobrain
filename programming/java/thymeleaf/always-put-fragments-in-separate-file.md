# Always put fragments in their own file
For some weird reason, fragment definitions get rendered. Therefore if you put a fragment definition in the same file as the usage, it will get rendered and weird stuff will ensue. Therefore, it's better to have fragments in their own files so they are rendered only when actually used.
