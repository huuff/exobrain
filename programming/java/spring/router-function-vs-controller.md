# Router Functions vs Controllers
* When declaring a controller using annotations such as `@GetMapping("<path>")`, `<path>` must be statically known (since it's an annotation argument). This means we can't get these using late binding, for example from another object using composition. This seems like a big flaw considering OOP is all about late binding. Note that the [[spring]] team suggests that this is a better fit for router functions[^1]
* Any standard [[aop]] complaint applies. [[aop]] hides any interaction by default and makes it feel like magic. Annotating a method with `@RequestMapping`, you have to know (through docs, or stackoverflow) which parameters you might declare that magically appear, or which annotations you can use. Instead, with router functions you know that any parameters you receive must be in the `ServerRequest` and anything you return must be in the `ServerResponse`.
  * Does this screw up type safety? Kinda, because you have to get contents from the `ServerRequest` and convert them manually. However, using a parameter annotated as `@QueryParameter` or `@PathVariable`, this conversion is at runtime anyway, only hidden.
