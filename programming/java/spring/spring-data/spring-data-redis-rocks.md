# What rocks about Spring Data Redis
I actually don't like Spring Data Redis, I use my own Kotlin library "siths", but I made this list to remind me of what's good about it:

* Integration with JMS for the pub/sub mechanism
* Integration with Spring Cache Abstraction
* [[spring-data/redis-atomic-counters]]
