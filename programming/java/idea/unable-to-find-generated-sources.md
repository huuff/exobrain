# iDEA can't find generated sources
* Try checking File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Maven -> Importing -> Generated sources folders. Try changing it until iDEA takes a hint and good luck.
* Literally try to delete the project and redownload it from the VCS. I've been suffering this issue for 3 days straight and that just solved it. Pretty sad.
