# Gradle advantages over maven
* **Flexible conventions**: Maven might be too opinionated, it assumes every project has only one Java source directory and only produces one single JAR file. Gradle can easily overcome these limitations.
* **Easily testable**: By writing your own custom [[tasks]], it's easy to test these as any other Java code. I don't think anything like this exists for Maven, except for testing plugins.
