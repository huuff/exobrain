# Single quotes vs double quotes (in languages that allow both)
I generally prefer double quotes, obviously in a lot of places the best option is to just switch depending on the content of the text.

## Single quotes
* Apparently more conventional in JavaScript/TypeScript
* Allows more convenient JSON

## Souble quotes
* Good when text has apostrophes (pretty usual in english)
* I think more languages have only these? (e.g. Java) So I guess they are more interoperable.
