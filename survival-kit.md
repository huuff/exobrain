# My survival kit
I always carry a lot of stuff in my backback that, over the time, has proven to be useful in a pinch. So I'm making this note lest I forget what sorts of stuff I might ever need when I'm outside.

### Backpack stuff
* Paper towels (or *kleenex*): There are a myriad of situations I might need these, and also weightless, so I should always wear a few of them. Carrying a roll of toilet paper would be a nice alternative but it always becomes kind of damp and messy if it's always there.
* A plastic bag: Also very useful and very easy to carry around. For example it might be useful if I need to carry something I don't have space for in my backpack.
* An umbrella: Not so easy to carry, but it's really calming carrying always one around, since I won't ever have to worry about forgetting it, or be surprised by unexpected rain without one.
* A neck gaiter: Also very easy to carry and makes a hell of a difference when it's cold.
* Water: Not so easy to carry around, but water is obviously necessary. I like to carry an aluminium water bottle in my backpack, and maybe some plastic ones in the car trunk. This isn't so easy, however, because I have to watch out so they don't go bad and replace them as appropriate.
* Wrist braces: I don't think I'll ever forget these because I need them whenever I'm using the keyboard.
* A power bank (and maybe a charger just in case)
* A toothbrush and paste: Once I started carrying it, I couldn't ever stop.
* A small mirror: Also always useful to check whether I'm looking unkempt. Also for getting lashes out of my eyes.
* Moisturizing cream: For my hands or my face, since I might have dermatitis.
* Sunscreem: I always forget to carry it, so it's safer to always have one at the bottom of the backpack.
* Extra clothes (at least a t-shirt): Also very necessary in case it's cold, lose some, or someone else needs it. This is harder to carry however, so maybe just for the car's trunk.
