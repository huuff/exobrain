# Take notes on:
* Don't know where I can put this since wallabag won't allow me to pocket it but: Read Keith Adams and Ole Agesen's paper on [[hardware-virtualization]].
* Turns out that my indexes (i.e., for example the `kubernetes.md` file) must be **OUTSIDE** of the folder that contains their notes for `emanote` to pick them up. I'm pretty sure this was the other way around (must be inside the directory) in `neuron`. Still, I have to change it everywhere.
* Links on titles don't work. I think I knew it, yet I created hundreds of notes doing so anyway.
* I'd like to use queries to display notes with specific tags in my indexes. For example, in Kubernetes, instead of curating and maintaing a list of best practices I know, autogenerate it by querying for the `best-practice` tag. But the emanote documentation is so scarce I don't even know whether this is possible yet!
