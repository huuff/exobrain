# TODO
* Write about different JS modules (I have a nice article in my wallabag)
* Webpack's `publicPath`
* Write on concatenative inheritance
* `this` in js:
  * Needing to call `bind` and when
  * Difference between the `function` and `arrow` syntax
* String can be types in typescript
* Apache vs nginx
* Fix my note on nullable properties in typescript. I think there are no nullable types? Only optional parameters and properties
* Note on `for ... in` vs `for ... of` (it sucks)
* Note on two-way binding
