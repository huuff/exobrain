# Ending g sound
For words that end with *-g*, this sounds like a */ç/* in the [[international-phonetic-alphabet]]. Note that this sound changes completely to a normal */ɡ/* sound when the letter is not in the end of the sentence. 

### Example
Chech out [könig](https://www.howtopronounce.com/german/k%C3%B6nig) vs [königin](https://www.howtopronounce.com/german/k%C3%B6nigin)
