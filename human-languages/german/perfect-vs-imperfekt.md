# Perfekt vs Imperfekt
There is no semantical difference between them. Aside from some specific rules such as [[haben-and-sein-imperfekt]], the only difference is stylistic:

* The perfetk is vastly preferred for coloquial speech
* The [[prateritum|imperfekt]] is more used in formal or rhethorical, written speech

For example, the sentence "I entered the bus":

* Perfekt: *Ich bin in den Bus eingestiegen* is more suited as reporting the sentence to a friend.
* Imperfekt: *Ich stieg in den Bus ein*

### Why is the *perfekt* preferred to the *imperfekt* for colloquial speech?
It's likely that's because the *imperfekt* is generally more complicated. A lot of verbs (==is this true?==) are irregular in the *imperfekt* but not in the *perfekt* so it's easier to guess the correct form of a *perfekt* conjugation.
