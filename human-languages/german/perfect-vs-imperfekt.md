# Perfekt vs Imperfekt
There is no semantical difference between them. Aside from some specific rules such as [[haben-and-sein-imperfekt]], the only difference is stylistic:

* The perfetk is vastly preferred for coloquial speech
* The imperfekt is more used in formal or rhethorical, written speech

For example, the sentence "I entered the bus":

* Perfekt: *Ich bin in den Bus eingestiegen* is more suited as reporting the sentence to a friend.
* Imperfekt: *Ich stieg in den Bus ein*
