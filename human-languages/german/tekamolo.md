# TEKAMOLO
A mnemotechnic rule to remember the position of adverbs in the [[nebensatz]]. It goes like this:

* TE: Temporal (adverbs of time)
* KA: Kausal (adverbs of cause)
* MO: Modal (adverbs of mode)
* LO: Lokal (adverbs of location)

It's important to know that this isn't the only right structure for the order of adverbs in german, but it's one that's guaranteed to be correct every time

### Example
* Martin ran in the morning quickly to his place because of the rain: Martin ist am Morgen wegen des Regens schnell nach Häuse geläuft
