# Gender of nouns by suffix
Some suffixes imply specific genders for nouns, so memorizing them makes it simple to deduce the gender of a noun. Note that these are not hard rules, but more like rules of thumb. Some words might have different etymologies or come from other languages so these rules do not apply.

### Neuter
* *-chen* like *das Tischchen*
* *-ling* like *das Tischling*
* *-um* like *das Stadium* or *das Ultimatum*
* *-o* like *das Auto* or *das Konto*

### Masculine
* *-er* like *der Keller* or *der Roller*
* *-ismus* like *der Kapitalismus* or *der Metabolismus*
* *-ling* as in *der Pfiferling* ==but I thought that was neuter??==
* *-ant* like in *der Elefant* but not in *das Restaurant* or *das Deodorant* (these come from other languages)
* *-or* like *der Motor*
