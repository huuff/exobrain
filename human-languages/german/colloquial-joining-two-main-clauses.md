# Joining two main clauses
It's a very colloquial way of speaking, where two main clauses are joined without any conjuntive in between. It's not grammatically correct, but very frequently used since it's shorter and more straightforward than the alternative.

* Colloquial: Ich habe gehört, Island ist schön
* Formal: Ich habe gehört, dass Island schön ist
