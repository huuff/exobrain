# German 1996 Reform
A substantial reform of german ortography. Some of the changes:

* Until then, repetitions of three letters were to be avoided, so double "s" followed by an s were changed by an [[eszett]]. The reform began allowing triple repeated letters. So before the reform it might have been (I don't actually know) *nu√üschokolade* (chocolate with nuts) but now it is *nussschokolade*. A classic one that's now allows is *schifffahrt* (trip by ship)
