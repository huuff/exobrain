# Tenses aren't particularly important in German
Germans tend to give temporal context to verbs using adverbs.


### Example
A german speaker could say the following in [[perfekt]] tense:

> Damals, haben die Wolken sich verzögen

Though the correct form ==is the previous one incorrect?== is:

> Damals, hatten die Wolken sich verzögen

In the [[plusquamperfekt]] tense. However, the *damals* adverb already indicates the correct time, so speakers might simplify the structure of the sentence by not using the plusquamperfekt tense.
