# So dass vs so that
These two seem very alike so they might be a [[german/false-friend]] but there are subtle differences in meaning.

* *So that* implies intention: *Claudia eats all the cherries so that there are none left for her brother*. This means that Claudia actually intends her brother to be left without any cherries.
* *So dass* has the same effect of indicating a logical conclusion, but it does not imply intention: *Claudia hat alle Kirsche gegessen so dass keine für ihren Bruder übrig bleiben*. This still means that Claudia ate all cherries, and that there are none left for her brother. But actually Claudia may have intended it, or it was maybe just an unwanted consequence (she didn't know there wouldn't be any more for her brother, for example)
