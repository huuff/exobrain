# Forming adjectives with city names
You can transform any city name into an adjective by adding the *-er* suffix. This means that whatever it refers to belongs to that city, and stays the name for all declinations, genders and numbers ==is this absolutely correct?==

* *Die Berliner KÃ¼che*: The kitchen of Berlin
* *Das Berliner Wetter*: The weather of Berlin
