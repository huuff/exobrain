# Wechselpräpositionen
Prepositions that can take either a [[dativ]] or an [[akkusativ]]. These prepositions take the accusative when they imply a change of place or state, and the dative otherwise.

### Example
The preposition *in* is a Wechselpräposition:

* When you're dancing inside a disco, it implies movement, but not change of location, so it takes the dative: *Ich tanze in der Diskothek*
* When you're dancing on the queue, while entering the disco, this implies a change of location, from outside of the disco to inside it: *Ich tanze in die Diskothek*
