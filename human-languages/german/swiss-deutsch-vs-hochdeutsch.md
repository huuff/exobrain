# Swiss deutsch vs Hochdeutsch
Swiss deutsch may be easier since it uses less declinations and verb tenses:

* Swiss deutsch doesn't have a [[prateritum]], everything in the past is [[perfekt]] though I believe past forms are different to hochdeutsch
* Swiss german has no [[eszett]], they just change everything by double "s"
* Swiss german has no *nun* (it's very german) so they only use *jetzt*
* Swiss german has no [[genitive]]
