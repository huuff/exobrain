# Eszett (ÃŸ)
A german letter that has the sound of a double s ("ss") (and replaced by it in some dialects such as swiss german). It's used in two cases

* When following a [[german-diphthongs|diphthong]].
* When following a long vowel sound.

This has some implications, such as that the double s ("ss") with the same sound follows only short vowels, and also that it makes it easy to discern the sound of a vowel by whether it's followed by an eszett or "ss"
