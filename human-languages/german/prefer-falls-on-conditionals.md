# Prefer *falls* to *wenn* for conditionals
Since [[wenn|*wenn* has some peculiarities]] (as it can be both "When" and "If"), *falls* can be preferable if you want to mean "If" unambiguously.

### Examples
* *Wenn Sie Fragen haben...*: Either "If you have questions" or "When you have questions"
* *Falls Sie Fragen haben...*: Exclusively "If you have questions"
