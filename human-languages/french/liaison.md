# Liaison
It's a phonetic alteration that's produced between two words when one ends and the next one starts with a vowel. In french usually [[silent-final-letter|most ending letters are silent]], but the *liaison* is added when the next one starts with a vowel.

### Examples
* For the phrase *les enfants*, even though the ending *s* in *les* is normally silent, it's pronounced here because the next word starts with *e*, a vowel.
