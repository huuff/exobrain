# Most final letters in french are silent
Applies in most cases, but there are some [[liaison|exceptions when the next letter is a vowel]]

### Some examples
* *Je suis professeur* (I am a teacher): here the ending *s* of *suis* is not pronounced (Pronounced *Je sui professeur*)
* However: *Je suis avocat* (I am a lawyer) here the last *s* of *suis* is pronounced (Pronounced *Je suis avocat*)
