# The origin of the circumflex in french
In french, usually when a word has a circumflex, it means that originally (for example, in the original latin word) there was an *s* in that word which is now "swallowed" (or shortened) by the circumflex.

### Example
The word *fÃªte* comes from the latin *festa* (party, feast)
