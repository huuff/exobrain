# BAGS mnemonic for adjective order
Most adjectives in french come after the name (for example *la voiture verte* (the green car)). However, some come BEFORE the name, and BAGS is a good mnemonic for remembering which kinds of adjectives go before the name:

* **B**eauty: *le beau homme* (the beautiful man)
* **A**ge: *le jeune homme* (the young man)
* **G**oodnes (or badness): *le bon cochon* (the good pig) or *la mauvaise souris* (the bad mouse)
* **S**size: *la grande maison* (the big house)
