# Pronouns in the imperative
Pronouns can go either before or after the verb depending on whether it's affirmative or negative, respectively:

Example: *Lève toi* vs *Ne te lève-pas*

Also note that for affirmative, the [[stressed-pronoun]] *toi* is used, while for the negative, the normal direct object *te* pronoun is used.
