# Mean vs median
The mean has several issues:
* It's highly affected by outliers
* It can only be used with [[types-of-variables|interval or ratio variables]]
* It's highly affected by [[skewness]]

However, it also has a significant plus:
* It uses every single score in the distribution

AFAIK, and I'm by no means knowledgeable, the mean is generally more used for [[parametric-tests]] and the median for [[non-parametric-tests]]. I suppose this is because the median is less affected by skewness and outliers.
