# Types of variables
* Nominal/categorical: These are different in name, but they don't represent different values of a property. For example, for a "country" variable, the values (Spain, Italy, France, ...) don't represent higher or lower values, but just different values.
* Ordinal: Different values can be ordered from lower to higher, but the difference between each one is not quantified. For example we might order the 10 richest persons in the world as an ordinal variable, but the difference in money is not significant, only the order in the list.
* Interval: Same as ordinal, but now the difference between values can be quantified.
* Ratio: Same as interval, but they include the value 0.
