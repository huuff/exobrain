# Types of sampling
There are many different ways in which a [[statistics/sample]] can be selected:

* Random sample: It's when all members of the population have the same chances of being in the sample
* Representative sample: A sample of the population that tries to be truthful to the characteristics of the population by controlling some variables. For example, if we know a population is composed of 60% men and 40% women, we might build our sample with the same proportions to control the gender variable.
* Convenience sampling: A sample is selected because it's easier to make. For example, if we want to test customer satisfaction for a store, we might choose to survey customers on a same day as they exit the store rather than going through a history of previous customers and randomly calling them for the survey.
