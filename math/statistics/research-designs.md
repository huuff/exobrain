# Research Designs
* Experimental design: The experimenter makes some groups, introduces some factor into each and compares the measures of some variable across them. For example, the researcher gives a newly developed pill against diabetes to one group and a placebo to another, and compares which one has more success.
* Quasi-experimental design: Similar to an experimental design, but instead of being done in a laboratory setting (i.e., a controlled environment), it's done "in the wild".
* Correlational design: The participants are not actually assigned into groups nor does the researcher manipulate any variable. Instead, a sample is selected from a population and variables are observed in them.

## Differences
For experimental and quasi-experimental designs, the researcher can control the introduction of the independent variable, and thus the confidence in the changes in dependent variables are changed by them increases. This means that we're able to determine *causality* for experiemental designs, while for correlational designs we can only determine *correlation*.

### Example
Two similar studies can be done with both designs. Suppose we want to check whether more hours of sleep increase working productivity.

* In one study, two groups are randomly selected. For one group, the duration of their sleep is increased by one hour, while the other remains the same. It turns out, that the group with the increased sleep also increases their work productivity.
* In another study, a random sample is selected. As it turns out, those individuals in the sample that slept longer on average, also used to have higher average work productivity.

For the first study, we can draw a *causality* relation between sleep and work productivity. In the end, it's us who chose to give these individuals a longer sleep schedule, not external factors, so the probability of the effect being a coincidence is much smaller.

For the second study, we only know there's a *correlation*. For all we know, higher productivity could increase longer sleep! Or there's a confounding factor that increases both! But we didn't control it.
