# The Empirical Rule (68-95-99.7)
The empirical rule says that the probability of finding some element in a [[normal-distribution]] is:
* 68% if within one [[standard-deviation]] (to the left and right) of the center
* 95% if within two [[standard-deviation]]s
* 99.7% if within three [[standard-deviation]]s
