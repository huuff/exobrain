# German weird ice cream
Apparently it's common in Germany to have some pretty special kinds of ice creams that imitate other foods. For example:

* *Spaghettieis* is an ice cream made of vanilla, shaped like noodles, covered in strawberry sauce that looks like tomato, and with sprinkles of coconut that look like grilled cheese, so it looks like a dish of spaghetti.
* *Pizzaeis* similarly, a base of vanilla with fruit on top that resembles a pizza
