I fucking hate this shit.

* Exercise specifications seem imprecise like "just rescale and normalize bro, apply this formula and don't think about it". Maybe I'm just dumb but some times I don't even know what I'm being asked to do.
* Others seem incomplete but you have to follow them to the letter, e.g. for the oscars exercise you're told to match for "something like" "Won x oscars", but some documents have "x won" and "x wins". Do these not count? Are these not "something like" the given example? However if you count these you'll fail
* Others are just wrong. My solution to the "Find airlines with the most routes with a 747 or 380" in M121 gives "OneWorld", but the correct answer is "SkyTeam". I've found [solutions online](https://github.com/aurasphere/mongodb-university-classes/blob/master/M121%20-%20The%20MongoDB%20Aggregation%20Framework/Chapter%203%20-%20Core%20Aggregation%20-%20Combining%20Information/Lab%203.3%20-%20Using%20%24lookup/Lab%203-3%20Solution.js) that also give "OneWorld", even though they claim the answer is "SkyTeam"! WTF! Has the dataset changed?
* So far for any course I've made the MongoDB IDE does not check anything, "Run Tests" just gives you an instant pass. Also it sucks. Why can't I resize the terminal? The "Run Tests" button is always hidden unless I am on fullscreen
* Most of the instructors look so fucking smug
